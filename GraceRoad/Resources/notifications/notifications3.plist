		<string>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to beburned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</string>

		<string>我若能說萬人的方言, 並天使的話語卻沒有愛, 我就成了鳴的鑼, 響的鈸一般. 我若有先知講道之能, 也明白各樣的奧祕, 各樣的知識. 而且有全備的信, 叫我能夠移山, 卻沒有愛, 我就算不得甚麼. 我若將所有的賙濟窮人, 又捨己身叫人焚燒, 卻沒有愛, 仍然與我無益. 愛是恆久忍耐, 又有恩慈. 愛是不嫉妒. 愛是不自誇. 不張狂. 不作害羞的事. 不求自己的益處. 不輕易發怒. 不計算人的惡. 不喜歡不義. 只喜歡真理. 凡事包容. 凡事相信. 凡事盼望. 凡事忍耐. 愛是永不止息. 先知講道之能, 終必歸於無有. 說方言之能, 終必停止, 知識也終必歸於無有. 我們現在所知道的有限, 先知所講的也有限. 等那完全的來到, 這有限的必歸於無有了. 我作孩子的時候, 話語像孩子, 心思像孩子, 意念像孩子. 既成了人, 就把孩子的事丟棄了. 我們如今彷彿對著鏡子觀看, 糢糊不清. ((糢糊不清原文作如同猜謎))到那時, 就要面對面了. 我如今所知道的有限. 到那時就全知道, 如同主知道我一樣. 如今常存的有信, 有望, 有愛, 這三樣, 其中最大的是愛.</string>

		<string>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.</string>

		<string>親愛的弟兄阿, 我們應當彼此相愛. 因為愛是從神來的. 凡有愛心的, 都是由神而生, 並且認識神. 沒有愛心的, 就不認識神. 因為神就是愛. 神差他獨生子到世間來, 使我們藉著他得生, 神愛我們的心, 在此就顯明了. 不是我們愛神, 乃是神愛我們, 差他的兒子, 為我們的罪作了挽回祭, 這就是愛了. 親愛的弟兄阿, 神既是這樣愛我們, 我們也當彼此相愛. 從來沒有人見過神. 我們若彼此相愛, 神就住在我們裡面, 愛他的心在我們裡面得以完全了. 神將他的靈賜給我們, 從此就知道我們是住在他裡面, 他也住在我們裡面. 父差子作世人的救主, 這是我們所看見且作見證的. 凡認耶穌為神兒子的, 神就住在他裡面, 他也住在神裡面. 神愛我們的心, 我們也知道也信. 神就是愛. 住在愛裡面的, 就住在神裡面, 神也住在他裡面. 這樣愛在我們裡面得以完全, 我們就可以在審判的日子, 坦然無懼. 因為他如何, 我們在這世上也如何. 愛裡沒有懼怕. 愛既完全, 就把懼怕除去. 因為懼怕理含著刑罰. 懼怕的人在愛裡未得完全. 我們愛, 因為神先愛我們. 人若說, 我愛神, 卻恨他的弟兄, 就是說謊話的. 不愛他所看見的弟兄, 就不能愛沒有看見的神((有古卷作怎能愛沒有看見的神呢)). 愛神的, 也當愛弟兄, 這是我們從神所受的命令. 凡信耶穌是基督的, 都是從神而生. 凡愛生他之神的, 也必愛從神生的. 我們若愛神, 又遵守他的誡命, 從此就知道我們愛神的兒女.</string>
